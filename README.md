# How It's Made:
Tech used: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, EJS

This inventory app is built using Node.js for the server-side logic and Express as the web framework. PostgreSQL is used as the database to store the games, developers, and genres. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is utilized as the templating engine to render dynamic HTML pages.

The app features three main tables in the database: games, developers, and genres. Users can add new entries to each of these tables through the web interface.

# Features:
Add new games to the inventory

Add developers and genres associated with each game

# Lessons Learned:
Building this inventory app was a great learning experience. It reinforced the importance of database design and how to manage relationships between different entities. Working with PostgreSQL and Express provided a solid understanding of building and interacting with a RESTful API. The project also highlighted the importance of template engines like EJS in rendering dynamic web pages.
